#   3. each of the components
#   2. the graph of components

# You said "Given 1 graph"? Where is it? Which graphs are we given?

# We are given the following:

#   2. Big (randomly) generated graph [however many we wish]
#   3. Real-life graphs (that is networks); specifically signed undirected social networks)
